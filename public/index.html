                            This is the 3D Wizard using the cartoon graphic style. We wouldn't implement this artwork style as it is much harder
                            to create these type of 3D graphics, but it will be here as an example of what could be done ideally.

                        <p> This is the 3D Wizard using a realistic graphic style. This would take a very skilled artist to make, and is only
                        here as an example of how graphics can be very realistic.</p>
